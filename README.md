This project is based on "Online FIR System for Bangladesh"

People can registered in this site and can view his/her profile on the site. He/She also edit his/her details.The main operation of the site that it contains
an FIR form. Filling up this form a victim will get an ID. Admin can see the victim's FIR. Victim have to go to his/her nearby police station.
After giving this ID the responsible officer can print the FIR by searching the FIR ID. This process is very time consuming.This system can reduce the
sufferings of the victim.

Admin can update,delete users and their FIRs.
